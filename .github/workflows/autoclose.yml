            Thank you for working on this pull request. However, we cannot accept your contribution as this pull request does not follow our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md). Per the guidelines outlined in our [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/development.md), you should download and setup [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to ensure that files are automatically configured to use expected indentation and line endings.

            Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contriubtions.
