feat!: add boolean dtype support to ndarray/min-dtype

This commit changes the return value when provided a boolean primitive. Previously, the function returned "generic", and now the function returns "bool".

BREAKING CHANGE: return "bool" when provided a boolean

To migrate, users explicitly handle "bool" return values. If "generic" is still desired, users should consolidate accordingly.
